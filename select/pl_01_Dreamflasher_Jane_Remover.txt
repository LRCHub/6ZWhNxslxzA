Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane
This song is fucking—
(futuro pianista)
These guys don't stand a chance
Please, God, save me,
I'm so turnt right now
(Allez, allez)
I disappeared like it's my
last night out
I don't know if he loves me,
but he loves me right now
I'ma lift his shirt off when
the lights go down
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
(Complete destruction by
shadow force)
It don't mean shit if
I don't hear you say it
(J-J-J-J-)
Screaming bloody, "J, J, J,
" I know what you talkin' 'bout
Hear you— uh
Two things I know how to do
is get that music and
the people loud
(Complete destruction by
shadow force)
I was gone for weeks,
spending 20K,
you can let your secrets out
(put your—,
put your— can you—?)
Cards on the table,
I ain't got shit left to
hide except my whereabouts, uh
Baby,
tell me what's the point
of preaching to the choir
if I can't see you in
the crowd?
(Can't see you in the crowd)
Please, God, save me,
I'm so turnt right now
I disappeared like it's my
last night out
I don't know if he loves me,
but he loves me right now
I'ma lift his shirt off when
the lights go—
Please, God, save me,
I'm so turnt right now
I dont know if he loves me,
but he loves me right now
Take my shit for granted
'cause it's just my life now
Put your cigs up,
put that fuckin' mic down
I got your hopes up,
now you scared to let me down
Bitches dick suck,
then they go and bite my sound
I think it's real love 'til
he leaves it at my house
And if I'm lip-locked
by tomorrow, shut me down
(Down, down down)
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
It don't mean shit if
I don't hear you say it
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
It don't mean shit if
I don't hear you say it
(Right now, right now)
Right-right now, right now,
right now
Right now, right now, right now,
right now
Right now, right now, right now,
right now
Right now, right now, right now,
right-
Please, God, save me,
I'm so turnt right now
I disappear like it's my
last night out
I don't know if he loves me,
but he loves me right now
I might lift his shirt up
when the lights go down
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
It don't mean shit if
I don't hear you say it
(J— J— J—)
Screaming bloody, "J, J, J, J"
Can you put your mouth on it?
Put your— put your mouth on it?
Put your— put your mouth on it?
Put your mouth on it?
Put your— put your mouth on it?
Put your mouth on it?
Put your— put your mouth on it?
Put your mouth on it?
Put your— put your— put
your— put your—
(Right now)
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
(Put your)
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
A thousand people scream
my fucking name
